// backend code -- app.js file
//frontend code --  public/js/script.js file

points to think on
    1. why uses socket.io 
    2. why Does socket.io Need an HTTP Server?
    3. Why Not ../public/js/script.js? --  In express when we use app.use(express.static("public")); -This makes the contents of public/ directly accessible as if they are at /.
    4. socket.emit() vs socket.send() vs socket.on()   -- socket.io methods 

steps 
1 npm inti -y 
2 install dependencies 
3 app.js file made and run server code wrote 
4 make necessary folders like views, public 
5 leaflet se scripts copy and paste in index.ejs  -- it is used to give feel of maps
6  socket io cdn ki script copy paste from net in index.ejs 

7 MUST SEE VIDEO FROM 14 MIN  TO 17 MIN AS THERE TOLD WHAT ARE STEPS WE NEED TO DO AND HOW TO DO -- WITHOUT SEEING THIS PART CANT PROCEED

8 in script.js worked onnavigator.geolocation.watchPosition fucntion 
9 using L.map() created a Leaflet map centered at [0,0] with zoom level 10. and L.tileLayer() to actually visiualize map 
10 send-location event jo emit kiya tha now receive it in backend i.e app.js using io.on  
11 then receive-location event emit kiya to sedn client location to server taki all those who are connnected can see his location 
12 wrote code for user-disconnected event in backend and then listend in frontend 

13 I got confused in app.js file as and when to use io.on() and socket.on() so did chatGPT -- 
    io.on("connection", (socket) => {...}) is used once, when a new client connects to the server, this function is triggered. Inside this function, you get a socket object, which represents that specific client. This is the entry point for all new clients connecting to the server.
     socket.on("event-name", (data) => {...}) is used inside io.on("connection"), because it handles events from a specific client. Ex listening send-location event for a specific clinet
14 io.emit() used  - When the server wants to broadcast an event to all clients
